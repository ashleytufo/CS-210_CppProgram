# CS-210_CppProgram

1️⃣ Summary
This program is used to analyze daily produce item sales in an effort to determine the optimal arrangement of the produce department. The program reads in a report of all items sold in a day, calculates how many times each item was purchased, and displays results in three different ways. The user may choose to view a histogram of the daily sales, view a textual representation of the daily sales with item name and number of sales, or view the number of times a particular item was sold in the day.

2️⃣ The Good Stuff
I believe I handled errors for data input very well and tried to limit the chances of a crash. I also tried to incorporate the abstraction principle through my modularization of the code, which was meant to make them easier to use for additional actions in the future. While I believe the code is over-commented, I believe I made it clear how the program functions.

3️⃣ Needed Improvements
The Python script should be a class of its own and should be able to create and access C++ class objects. This would make the code more adaptable for future improvements and new features. Additionally, by connecting to a database and storing results for multiple days, the users could see the averages of the sales for a more accurate representation of most-sold items. A database would allow the user to view subsets of data, for instance in a particular timeframe. This may help them see the difference between popular items on weekdays vs. weekends.

4️⃣ Challenges
CPython was the biggest challenge for me. I wanted to do more with it but I struggled to understand how to expand upon the starter code. I spent additional time watching videos and tutorials to gain more knowledge but opted to focus on the project requirements rather than risk experimentation at the time. I will be doing a deep dive into CPython and expanding my understanding so that I may optimize its use in the future.

5️⃣ Transferable Skills
The experience gained in debugging and error handling will transfer very well to other courses and projects. Additionally, working with classes and modularizing my code will help lay a good foundation on which to build in the future.

6️⃣ Maintainable, Readable, Adaptable
The program is split into multiple classes based on its primary functions. Reading the code is made easier by separating these files and commenting to describe their function. Adapting this code to handle additional Python functions or files would be simple since the PyHandler is only an interface between the program and the .py file. Additionally, the input and output handlers will make it easy to further adapt the program by either reusing functions like reading in the menu choice or with new methods to output different data. Smaller sections of code, separated by function, along with descriptive comments allow for the code to be easily maintained over time.
